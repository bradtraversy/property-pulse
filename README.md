# Property Pulse

> A web application to help you find your next rental property.

This is the main project from my [Next 14 From Scratch Course](https://www.traversymedia.com/nextjs-from-scratch)

This is the old version of the app that uses API routes for properties, messaging, etc. The current/latest version of the courses uses server actions. The updated code can be found [here](https://github.com/bradtraversy/property-pulse-nextjs) as well as in the [refactor branch](https://github.com/bradtraversy/property-pulse/tree/refactor).

## Important notes

If you are following along with the course and running into issues, then please
take the time to read the README in the [bugfix branch](https://github.com/bradtraversy/property-pulse/tree/bugfix)
as this solves many common problems.

There is also a [refactor branch](https://github.com/bradtraversy/property-pulse/tree/refactor)
where the code has been heavily refactored to stay true to NextJS recommended
best practices by using querying the database directly from our server
components for data fetching, and performing updates and adding data using
server actions.  
The refactor also makes deployment a fair bit smoother.  
The course is currently being re recorded for a re release using the code in
the refactor branch.

The `_theme_files` folder contains the pure HTML files with Tailwind classes.
